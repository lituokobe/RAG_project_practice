Similar to many existing deep learning libraries, LayoutParser comes with a community model hub for distributing layout models. End-users can upload their self-trained models to the model hub, and these models can be loaded into a similar interface as the currently available LayoutParser pre-trained models. For example, the model trained on the News Navigator dataset [17] has been incorporated in the model hub.",
